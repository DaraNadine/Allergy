# Predicting Childrens' Food Allergies

## Can we predict a child's future food allergies based on their current ones?

### Business Problem

The prevalence of food allergies in children has increased at a rapid rate within the past couple of decades. "Between 1997 and 2011, food allergies among children increased 50% and now affect 6 million US children" [1]:[source](https://community.kidswithfoodallergies.org/blog/10-shareable-images-for-food-allergy-awareness-week-1). 
As a millenial born in 1991, my elementary school experience was void of strict protocols on outside food, unlike the current school landscape. Classmates often had cupcakes or pizza brought in to celebrate birthdays and peanut butter crackers were the unofficial snack of field trips.

The stakeholder is Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE). The objective is to use existing data to predict and model patients' future food allergies. The ability to predict an increase of a specific food allergy identifies new trends and allows research to pivot and address them.

### Data

The dataset was obtained from [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/record/44529#.YmAFlZPMIiz). It entails information on food allergies alongside preexisting conditions on a peer reviewd study from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia of patients born in 1983-2012. 
There were 333,200 individuals in the dataset. The columns were then pared down as listed below.
